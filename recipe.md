Instructions-
1.To make the triple berry sauce:

2.In a medium saucepan, combine the berries, lemon juice, and vanilla extract and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until berries are tender and juicy, approx 10 minutes.

3.Stir in the sugar and continue to cook another 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly.

4.Keep warm while you make the pancakes.

To make the buttermilk pancakes:
1.In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together egg, buttermilk, and oil.

2.Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir until wet ingredients are just incorporated. Batter will be lumpy and will contain pockets of flour - don't over mix!

3.Pour approx 1/4 cup batter onto a hot, lightly greased griddle or heavy frying pan. Spread batter if it's quite thick.

4.Cook over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown, turning when edges are slightly dry.

5.Serve warm with triple berry sauce.
